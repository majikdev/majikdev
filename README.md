Welcome to my GitHub profile! :mailbox_with_mail:

It might look empty, but that is because most of my work is closed-source.<br>
I develop games as a hobby, you can check them out on my [**itch.io page**](https://majikgames.itch.io/)!

My favourite language is C++, but C# and Java are okay, I suppose.
